## Unsplash Attribution

When using images from Unsplash, attribution is appreciated but not required.
However, it's good practice to include photographer credits:

Format: `Photo by [Photographer Name] on Unsplash`

## Image Optimization

Before deploying, optimize all images:

1. **Resize to appropriate dimensions** (don't use 4000px images for thumbnails)
2. **Compress images** using tools like:
   - TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com)
   - Squoosh (https://squoosh.app)
   - ImageOptim (Mac)
3. **Convert to WebP format** with JPEG fallbacks for older browsers
4. **Use lazy loading** (already implemented in HTML with `loading="lazy"`)
