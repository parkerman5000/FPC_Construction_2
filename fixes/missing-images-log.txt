FPC Construction — Missing/Broken Image Audit
Date: 2026-02-20

SITE TYPE: Static HTML (GitHub Pages) — no database, no wp-content

=== PLACEHOLDER IMAGES (exist but are stock/generic) ===

All 8 placeholder images exist in the repo at assets/images/placeholder/:
  - hero-bg.jpg         — Referenced in styles.css (.hero background-image)
  - about-team.jpg      — Referenced in index.html (About section)
  - cta-bg.jpg          — Referenced in styles.css (.cta-banner background-image)
  - project-1.jpg       — Referenced in index.html (Projects grid card 1)
  - project-2.jpg       — Referenced in index.html (Projects grid card 2)
  - project-3.jpg       — Referenced in index.html (Projects grid card 3)
  - project-4.jpg       — Referenced in index.html (Projects grid card 4)
  - project-5.jpg       — Referenced in index.html (Projects grid card 5)
  - project-6.jpg       — Referenced in index.html (Projects grid card 6)

NOTE: These are placeholder/stock images, not actual FPC project photos.
The gallery-config.json can override project card images at runtime via JS.

=== REAL PROJECT PHOTOS ===

Directory: assets/images/projects/
Status: EMPTY (contains only .gitkeep)
Action needed: Run the FPC Image Picker tool (tools/image-picker/) to process
and place real construction photos here, then update gallery-config.json.

=== BROKEN/HARDCODED URL CHECK ===

No hardcoded staging, localhost, or mismatched domain URLs found.
All image references use relative paths (assets/images/...) or are
loaded dynamically from gallery-config.json (Google Drive / Supabase).

=== ZERO-BYTE / SYMLINK CHECK ===

No zero-byte files found.
No broken symlinks found.

=== FALLBACK BEHAVIOR ===

Added JS onerror handler: broken images get .img-broken class which
displays branded #1a1a2e background with "Photo coming soon" text.
Gallery images already had onerror fallback to placeholder images (in main.js).
